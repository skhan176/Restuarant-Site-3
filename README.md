# Restuarant-Site-3
Add Bootstrap to the site. Style the site navigation so that you are using either tabs or pills. Use a jumbotron or page header to call out big news - your restaurant is opening a new location! Make the site responsive using Bootstrap's grid system. The menu items should stack well, with no overlapping. The front page content should stack as well. Change the Home link to use an Icon from one of the supported fonts that looks like a house. Add a Carousel that rotates with three pieces of information: We're opening a new location! We're rolling out our seasonal menu, with special options for this season. The Drink of the Month is SG Special Brew. Use the Bootstrap form items for your Contact Us form, validate in Javascript that data has been provided and give a message that the information is valid without submitting it anywhere. Make sure that users who have JavaScript disabled know that this site is best viewed with JavaScript enabled.
